Examples of GitHub workflows that use git remote add origin [Webpage Screenshot Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/webpage-screenshot).

There are quite a few examples of GitHub workflows that use Webpage Screenshot Action in the project's [README](https://github.com/karol-brejna-i/webpage-screenshot-action/blob/main/README.md) and in [examples/](https://github.com/karol-brejna-i/webpage-screenshot-action/blob/main/examples) directory.
On the other hand, they are focused on the action itself and not on the workflows. The examples show different modes, explain configuration options, and so on.

This repo shows how to use the action in different scenarios.

The examples include:
- [Adding a commit with a screenshot when PR is created](./replace_in_place.md)

Check selected examples (docs) for details like how to reproduce the example.
